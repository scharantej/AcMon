### Flask Application Structure

**HTML Files:**

1. **dashboard.html**: Displays the system monitoring dashboard
2. **errors.html**: Logs and displays detected errors
3. **troubleshooting.html**: Provides tools for troubleshooting errors

**Routes:**

1. **`/dashboard`**: Displays the dashboard interface
2. **`/errors`**: Retrieves and displays logged errors
3. **`/troubleshoot`**: Provides access to troubleshooting tools
4. **`/monitor`**: Background process for continuous system monitoring
5. **`/alert`**: Triggers alerts for detected errors

## Additional Steps

In addition to the basic structure outlined above, the following steps can enhance the monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities of the application:

- Implement a data visualization library, such as Plotly or Dash, to create interactive dashboards.
- Integrate with external services, such as Slack or email, for notifications and alerts.
- Establish a testing framework to ensure the reliability of the monitoring and troubleshooting mechanisms.
- Monitor system resources, such as CPU and memory usage, to detect potential performance bottlenecks.
